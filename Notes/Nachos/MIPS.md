# MIPS

> MIPS stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages

## Introduction

* ISA (Instruction Set Architecture): RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

## Registers

> Nachos implement all the thirty-two MIPS R2/3000 Registers.
> Additionally, with 8 more special purpose register for better simulation and debug usage.

* thirty-two 32-bit GPRs (General-Purpose Reigsters): store both data and addresses
* thirty-two 32-bit FPRs (Floating-Point Registers): store floating point numbers
* SPRs (Special-Purpose Registers): hold program state
  * program counter (PC), also called the instruction pointer
  * status register: hold truth values often used to determine whether some instruction should or should not be executed

> PC and status register might be combined in program status word (PSW) register. (IBM System/360 architecture)

### Program Counter Related Registers

The Mips processor is a "two-stage" pipeline processor; that is, it has 2 program counter registers - PCReg and NextPCReg.

* PCReg: for the next instruction to execute
* NextPCReg: for the instruction after that

While the processor is executing one instruction, it can simultaneously be preparing the next one to execute.

#### Exception Related Problem

How should these registers be adjusted before returning from a system call that simply continues execution of the user thread that made the system call?

Example: page fault exception

the Mips instruction that caused the page fault will need to be executed again

Example: system call

we should not execute the Mips instruction that caused the exception, since it was the syscall instruction, as this would cause an infinite loop of calls

> So the question is whether the PC registers have already been incremented when the syscall is made or not. The answer is that they have **not** been incremented. So before returning from the system call, the PC registers for the calling thread must be incremented properly!

#### Nachos User-Space Register

There is the definition of user register and related operations in `code/threads/thread.h`.

It says there are two sets of CPU registers, each to record state in different mode.

* user code running state
* kernel code running state

```c
class Thread {

    ...

  private:

    ...

#ifdef USER_PROGRAM
// A thread running a user program actually has *two* sets of CPU registers -- 
// one for its state while executing user code, one for its state 
// while executing kernel code.

    int userRegisters[NumTotalRegs];	// user-level CPU register state

  public:
    void SaveUserState();		// save user-level register state
    void RestoreUserState();		// restore user-level register state

    AddrSpace *space;			// User code this thread is running.
#endif

};
```
